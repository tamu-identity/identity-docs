# Registration

Registration to use the API is easy.  Just go to the [Clients](https://mqs.tamu.edu/rest/clients/) page and log in using your NetID. 
From here, you can manage your client applications, obtain application identifiers and shared secrets, and specify who has access to that information.

## Adding a Client

From the [Clients](https://mqs.tamu.edu/rest/clients/) page click the link to "Register a new web services client". You will be asked for a name and optionally a description and URL for your client application.
These are for your benefit, to help you keep track of multiple clients.

You will also be asked to provide contact information. This should be the person responsible for maintaining the application. You may update your client to change this information at any time.

Once you have filled out the required fields, click the "Add" button to create your client identifier and shared secret. The client will have immediate access to search the directory for public, unsuppressed information.

## Adding a Manager

If more than one person needs access to view and update a client's details, you can add managers to the client account. Be careful when adding managers, as they will have the same privileges as you. These include:

- Viewing the account identifier and shared secret
- Updating the account name, description, url and contact information
- Adding and removing other managers

To add a manager, click on the link for the client you want to edit. At the bottom of the client details page, there is a list of managers. 
This includes the user that created the client account. Below the list is the Add Manager button. Click that button, enter the NetID of the user you want to make a manager, and then click Add.

## Removing a Manager

If you want to remove a manager, simply go to the details page for your client account and click the Remove button next to the manager's name.
Note that you cannot remove yourself as a manager, to prevent accidentally disabling your access to the service.
