# NetID Requests

All students, staff, and faculty automatically receive NetID accounts at Texas A&M. We offer several types of NetID accounts which can be requested on behalf of contractors, visting scholars, and other types of affiliates. 

Additionally, NetIDs can be created for the purposes of least privileged access, or for automated processes to authenticate.

## Account Creation Requests

The various types of NetIDs are available from the service listings on [it.tamu.edu](it.tamu.edu).

## Data Feeds & One-Time Data Reports

To request exported identity data, you must have an application or service-specific need for information about students, faculty, or staff, and will use the data only for official Texas A&M University administrative or academic purposes. 

If the service provider is a non-campus entity, the service provider should have a campus sponsor fill out the form. Contacts for the request should be Texas A&M University System employees.
